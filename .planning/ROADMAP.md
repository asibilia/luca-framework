# Roadmap

## Overview

**Current Milestone:** v3.3.0 — Cognitive Maturity & Observer Depth

---

## v3.3.0 — Cognitive Maturity & Observer Depth

**Theme:** Self-tuning agents, learning loops, advanced observer views.
**Estimated effort:** 55-75 hours across 8+ phases
**Strategic objectives:** O1 (better outcomes), O3 (observability depth), O4 (ecosystem groundwork)

| Phase | Items              | Title                                               | Effort                    |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1     | #95 (Phases A+B+C) | Close learning loop: Apply-Measure-Refine ✓         | DONE                      |
| 2     | #13                | Adaptive complexity self-tuning ✓                   | DONE                      |
| 3     | #94                | Deferred/lazy recall ✓                              | DONE                      |
| 4     | #83                | Knowledge Graph Explorer ✓                          | DONE                      |
| 5     | #84, #85           | Semantic Search + Contradiction views ✓             | DONE                      |
| 6     | #86                | Entity Deep Dive view                               | MODERATE (4-6h)           |
| 7+    | #18, #55, #54, #16 | Semantic embeddings, tribunal, skill graph, interop | Deferred within milestone |

## v4.0.0 — Plugin Ecosystem

| Items | Title                                      | Effort            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| #17   | Plugin Marketplace with Community Registry | CRITICAL (40-60h) |

Deferred by design. Intelligence moat (#95, #13) must exist before ecosystem makes sense.

## Backlog (Unassigned)

| Todo | Title                             | Target           | Reason                                                              |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #37  | Test suite fragility              | Dedicated effort | Testing reintroduction per `.planning/notes/0-reintroduce-tests.md` |
| #96  | Observer todo tracking (MuninnDB) | v3.3+            | Re-scoped from #64, low priority                                    |

---

## Closed (By Design)

| Todo | Reason                                                                                  |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #59  | Context pruning works correctly in memory/ (T1). Domain placement question, not a bug.  |
| #60  | Harness-aware update command works. Verification gap, not functionality gap.            |
| #61  | Duplicate of #37. Tests intentionally removed per MEMORY.md.                            |
| #62  | Dual-write atomicity — current JSON backup is pragmatic. Over-engineering for dev tool. |

## Closed (Backlog Audit 2026-03-08)

| #48    | Obsolete — SpacetimeDB schema being deleted                   |
| #49    | Superseded — new views include empty states natively          |
| #56    | Obsolete — SpacetimeDB schema being deleted                   |
| #64    | Re-scoped as #96 (MuninnDB-native)                            |
