'@alecsibilia/luca-framework': patch

Consolidate the release + npm publish pipeline into a single workflow.

The previous setup split the flow across two workflows: `release.yml` created the GitHub Release, and `publish.yml` listened for `release: published` and pushed to npm. That chaining never fired, because GitHub intentionally suppresses downstream workflow triggers for events created by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` — a recursion-prevention measure. The result: GitHub releases were being cut for every merged Version PR, but nothing ever reached npm.

- Merged the publish job into `release.yml` as a dependent job gated on the changesets action's `published` output.
- Deleted `publish.yml`.
- Updated `.github/scripts/create-release.ts` to emit the `New tag: <pkg>@<version>` line that `changesets/action` parses out of the publish command's stdout to set `published=true`.
- Disabled the action's built-in `createGithubReleases` behavior so it doesn't duplicate what `create-release.ts` already does (custom `vX.Y.Z` tag format + CHANGELOG-sourced release notes).
