'@alecsibilia/luca-framework': patch
---

Bundle the `luca-mastracode` harness into the framework's published tarball.

Fixes `luca run` for users who install `@alecsibilia/luca-framework` from npm. Previously the command tried to resolve the harness at `$CWD/node_modules/@alecsibilia/luca-mastracode/…`, but that package is intentionally private and is never published, so the harness was never present on disk and `luca run` bailed with "Could not locate luca-mastracode harness."

- Added a `build:done` hook to `build.config.ts` that copies the sibling `luca-mastracode` package (`src/`, `commands/`, `rules/`, `skills/`) into `dist/mastracode/`, preserving the layout the harness expects from `import.meta.url`.
- Added the harness's runtime deps (`@mastra/core`, `@mastra/libsql`, `@mastra/memory`, `mastracode`) to the framework's `dependencies` so they resolve from the framework's own install.
- Reworked `run.ts` installed-mode resolution to point at `<luca-framework>/dist/mastracode/src/index.ts` via a new `resolveFrameworkPackageRoot()` helper, instead of the user's cwd `node_modules`. Workspace/dev resolution is unchanged.
