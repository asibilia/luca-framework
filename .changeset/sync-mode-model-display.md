Sync TUI status bar model display with our dynamic mode model resolution.

The mastracode harness persists per-mode model IDs in thread settings and a model pack system. Our custom pipeline modes (luca:discuss, luca:1-triage through luca:6-finalize) are not part of any model pack, so the TUI status bar would show stale model IDs after upgrades — even though API calls were correctly using the dynamic model resolver and sending the right model.

Now we call `harness.switchModel()` on every `mode_changed` event with the result of our resolver function, forcing the harness internal state (and status bar display) to stay in sync with what we send to the API.
